# What do you need to know about context
- Context is a link to the location of a widget in the tree structure of widgets.
- Context can belong to only one widget.
- If a widget has child widgets, then the context of the parent widget becomes the parent context for the contexts of direct child elements.
- A widget is visible only in its own context or in the context of its parent context.
- => Thus, it becomes clear that knowing the childrenâ€™s context, you can easily find the parent widget. Conversely, using the parent context you can find the child widget.
